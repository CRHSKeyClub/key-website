# Enhanced Announcement Feature Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the enhanced announcement feature that now supports images in addition to text.

## Features Added

### 1. Image Upload Support
- **Camera Integration**: Take photos directly from the app
- **Gallery Selection**: Choose images from device gallery
- **Image Preview**: See selected images before posting
- **Image Removal**: Remove selected images before posting

### 2. Enhanced Display
- **Image Display**: Announcements now show images alongside text
- **Image Modal**: Tap images to view them in full screen
- **Responsive Layout**: Images adapt to different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations for image uploads

### 3. Database Enhancements
- **Image Storage**: Images stored in Supabase Storage
- **Database Schema**: Updated announcements table with image fields
- **URL Management**: Automatic image URL generation and storage

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Updated Schema
Execute the updated `database_schema.sql` file which includes:

```sql
-- Create announcements table with image support
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS announcements (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url TEXT,
    image_filename VARCHAR(255),
    created_by VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup
Create a new storage bucket for announcement images:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Create a new bucket called `announcement-images`
4. Set the bucket to public (for image viewing)
5. Configure RLS policies if needed

### 3. Storage RLS Policies
Add these policies to your `announcement-images` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload images
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload announcement images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'announcement-images' AND 
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow public access to view images
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to announcement images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'announcement-images');
```

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are already included in your `package.json`:

- `expo-image-picker`: For camera and gallery access
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: For database and storage operations

## Usage Guide

### For Admins (Creating Announcements)

1. **Navigate to Announcements**: Go to the Announcements screen
2. **Create New**: Tap the floating action button (+)
3. **Add Content**: 
   - Enter title and message
   - Optionally add an image using camera or gallery
4. **Preview**: Review your announcement with image preview
5. **Post**: Tap "Post Announcement" to publish

### For All Users (Viewing Announcements)

1. **Browse**: View all announcements in the main list
2. **View Images**: Tap on any image to view it in full screen
3. **Close Modal**: Tap outside the image or the close button to return

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components Modified

1. **CreateAnnouncementScreen.js**
   - Added image picker functionality
   - Integrated with Supabase Storage
   - Enhanced UI with image preview

2. **AnnouncementsScreen.js**
   - Added image display in announcement cards
   - Implemented full-screen image modal
   - Enhanced layout for image support

3. **SupabaseService.js**
   - Added announcement management methods
   - Implemented image upload functionality
   - Enhanced error handling

### Image Processing

- **Format**: Images are converted to JPEG format
- **Quality**: Set to 80% for optimal file size
- **Aspect Ratio**: Fixed to 16:9 for consistency
- **Storage**: Unique filenames with timestamps

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can upload images
- **File Validation**: Images are validated before upload
- **Storage Limits**: Consider implementing file size limits
- **Content Moderation**: Consider adding content filtering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure camera and gallery permissions are granted
   - Check device settings for app permissions

2. **Upload Failed**
   - Verify Supabase Storage bucket exists
   - Check RLS policies are correctly configured
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. **Images Not Displaying**
   - Verify image URLs are accessible
   - Check Supabase Storage bucket is public
   - Clear app cache if needed

### Debug Steps

1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Test image upload with smaller files
4. Check storage bucket permissions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Multiple Images**: Support for multiple images per announcement
2. **Image Editing**: Basic image editing capabilities
3. **Compression**: Automatic image compression
4. **Caching**: Local image caching for offline viewing
5. **Categories**: Image categorization and filtering

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Load images as needed
2. **Thumbnails**: Generate and use image thumbnails
3. **CDN**: Use CDN for faster image delivery
4. **Caching**: Implement image caching strategies
